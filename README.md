# Programming Bitcoin in Rust


This is a work in progress. We're implementing the book "Programming Bitcoin" in Rust as an exercise to learn both about Rust and the inner workings of Bitcoin.

Each chapter may have different implementations, produced by different developer teams.

The code might not be perfect, as for many this is their first contact with Rust.

Enjoy!
